Athens
That Athens had the worst of it in this war is certain

Two other passes, farther to the west, were crossed by the roads from Plataea to Athens and to Megara respectively

Mr. Anagnos is in Athens now

The inhabitants sided with Athens during the Peloponnesian War, and during the Roman invasion their city was of considerable importance

Greece
The most famous adytum in Greece was in the temple of Apollo at Delphi

I read the histories of Greece, Rome and the United States

It was the Iliad that made Greece my paradise

The range of Mount Geraneia extends across the country from east to west, forming a barrier between continental Greece and the Peloponnesus


-----------------------
Tehran
He appears only concerned to follow the instructions he receives from Tehran, namely to persecute Iranian refugees in Iraq

A widely-held view in Tehran is that the pragmatic conservatives are keener to strike a bargain with the US than are the liberal reformists

After two hours ' playing dodgem through Tehran's insane morning traffic I was genuinely relieved to find myself still alive

Charles Grant, just returned from a week in Tehran, presents a vivid portrait of a political system under pressure

Iran
In 316 Antigonus had defeated and killed Eumenes and made himself supreme from the Aegean to Iran, and Cassander had 1 For details see separate articles on the chief generals

Zoroastrianism was the national religion of Iran, but it was not permanently restricted to the Iranians, being professed by Turanians as well

The later tradition and the Shahname of Firdousi makes him (in the modern form Kai Gushtasp) king of Iran

In the east of Iran the novel creed first acquired a solid footing, and subsequently reacted with success upon the West

The first printed edition appeared in London in 1553

This year his brother Robert was senior sheriff of London

In 1522 Douglas was stricken by the plague which raged in London, and died at the house of his friend Lord Dacre

Mossman thinks that the apparent increase at Edinburgh and London in the later decades is to some extent at least real


-----------------------
England
He was glad to go back to England to see his home and his friends once more

In 1890 he removed to England, and in 1899 was naturalized

He decided that he must attend to his son's education by finding a tutor and putting the boy in his charge, then he ought to retire from the service and go abroad, and see England, Switzerland and Italy

Madrid
He was educated there at Madrid University, where his Radicalism soon got him into trouble, and he narrowly escaped being expelled for his share in student riots and other demonstrations against the governments of Queen Isabella

The whole work in fifty-one volumes was published at Madrid (1747-1886)

We took Vienna, Berlin, Madrid, Naples, Rome, Warsaw, all the world's capitals

Florez led a retired, studious and unambitious life, and died at Madrid on the 10th of August 1773


-----------------------
Spain
Antonio and Francesco both having died childless, the duchy passed to Charles of Bourbon (Don Carlos), infante of Spain, who, becoming king of Naples in 1734, surrendered Parma and Piacenza to Austria, but retained the artistic treasures of the Farnese dynasty which he had removed from Parma to Naples

In 1526 he was sent out in command of an expedition fitted out for the purpose of determining by astronomical observations the exact line of demarcation, under the treaty of Tordesillas, between the colonizing spheres of Spain and Portugal, and of conveying settlers to the Moluccas

Sebastian Cabot had in 151 9 deserted England for Spain, and had received from King Charles the post of pilot-major formerly held by Juan de Solis

In 1542 the settlement of Buenos Aires was re-established by an expedition sent for the purpose from Spain, under a tried adelantado, Cabeza de Vaca

Bangkok
The result is that practically all the trade of these states is in the hands of Bangkok Chinese firms, of a certain number of European houses and others, while most of the manual labour connected with the teak industry is done by Ka Mus, who migrate in large numbers from the left bank of the Mekong

The khiao were invested by a gold dish, betel-box, spittoon and teapot, which were sent from Bangkok and returned at their death or deposition

Two companies provide Bangkok with a complete system of electric tramways, and the streets are lined with shade-trees and lit by electricity

The climate of Bangkok has without doubt recently changed

Thailand
In Thailand they are started off with tiny red plankton

This village is a relatively remote community in modern Thailand

Many people believe the white elephant is a Chinese icon when in fact the mythology surrounding such a rare occurrence in nature comes from Thailand

Peninsular Malaysia extends south from Thailand to the Johor Strait, within sight of the island republic of Singapore

Islamabad
Islamabad is the capital city of Pakistan. 

Islamabad is the pakistan's ninth-most populous city, with a population of over 1.2 million people, and is federally administered by the Pakistani government as part of the Islamabad Capital Territory. 

In the 1960s, Islamabad replaced Rawalpindi as Pakistan's national capital. 

Islamabad is home to twenty universities, including Bahria University, Quaid-e-Azam University, PIEAS, COMSATS University, and NUST.

Pakistan
Fortunately, since Iowa is exactly halfway around the world from Pakistan, we were able to visit countries in Asia, including India and Nepal, Europe, and even Northern Africa

Users from all around the world, including individuals from Norway, Brunei, Trinidad and Tobago, and Pakistan spent more time on the site per visit than those in the United States

When speaking about oriental area rugs, the term refers to rug designs with influences from a large portion of Asia, from as far east as China, all the way to Pakistan, Turkey, Iran and India, including what was formerly known as Persia

The globetrotting couple was seen in Pakistan, where a pregnant Angelina Jolie toured earthquake-devastated areas as a goodwill ambassador for the UN

Beijing
That said, China's neighbors still harbor suspicions about Beijing's long-term intentions

Beijing has repeatedly urged Iraq to allow arms inspectors to return

True, the Forbidden City 's low-rise faÃ§ade seems dwarfed by the skyscrapers now vying for space on the Beijing skyline

Beijing Pink- has a sweet and hot flavor which is perfect for oriental dishes

China
A matching china cabinet held fine china, crystal and silverware

The emperor Justinian (483-565), in whose reign the greatness of the Eastern empire culminated, sent two Nestorian monks to China, who returned with eggs of the silkworm concealed in a hollow cane, and thus silk manufactures were established in the Peloponnesus and the Greek islands

The earliest Arabian traveller whose observations have come down to us is the merchant Sulaiman, who embarked in the Persian Gulf and made several voyages to India and China, in the middle of the 9th century

Masudi, a great traveller who knew from personal experience all the countries between Spain and China, described the plains, mountains and seas, the dynasties and peoples, in his Meadows of Gold, an abstract made by himself of his larger work News of the Time

Tokyo
Tokyo was never a centre of ceramic production

Whereas in Tokyo the number of frosty nights during a year does not average much over 60, the corresponding number in Sapporo on the north-west of Yezo is 145

He'd lived in Tokyo before Rhyn dragged him to the castle as his charge d'affairs

On this tour he visited Japan, and on the 2nd of October, at Tokyo, made a speech which had an important effect in quieting the apprehensions of the Japanese on the score of the treatment of their people on the Pacific coast


-----------------------
Japan
North China and Japan also have many forms of life in common

This grandiose project was unexpectedly destroyed by the energetic resistance of Japan, who had ear-marked the Hermit Kingdom for herself, and who declared plainly that she would never tolerate the exclusive influence of Russia in Manchuria

Turning to the tailless or so-called Manx cats, in which the tail should be represented merely by a tuft of hair without any remnant of bone, it seems that the strain is to be met with in many parts of Russia, and there is a very general opinion that it originally came from Japan or some other far eastern country

Though Japan is far removed from western Europe, and though a few generic forms and still fewer families inhabit the one without also frequenting the other, yet there is a most astonishing similarity in a large portion of their respective birds

Berlin
When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, I was an undergraduate at Rice University

He became teacher of science successively at the French gymnasium in Berlin, and at the military academy, and on the foundation of the university of Berlin in 1810 he was chosen professor of physics

He died at Berlin on the Irth of October 1851

He was appointed professor of physics at Berlin in 1839, and died there on the 12th of July 1877


-----------------------
Germany
However, the duties of archchancellor for Italy were generally discharged by deputy, and after the virtual separation of Italy and Germany, the title alone was retained by the elector

The theory was that all the imperial business in Germany was supervised by the elector of Mainz, and for Italy by the elector of Cologne

In the universities of the Netherlands and of lower Germany, as yet free from the conservatism of the old-established seats of learning, the new system gained an easy victory over Aristotelianism, and, as it was adapted for lectures and examinations, soon became almost as scholastic as the doctrines it had supplanted

Stuttgart is the centre of the publishing trade of south Germany, and it has busy industries in everything connected with the production of books


-----------------------
Rome
If you visit Rome and make your way to the Forum, nearby you will see the Arch of Titus

I read the histories of Greece, Rome and the United States

All of Rome was in terror

Though it was not clear what the artist meant to express by depicting the so-called King of Rome spiking the earth with a stick, the allegory apparently seemed to Napoleon, as it had done to all who had seen it in Paris, quite clear and very pleasing


-----------------------
Italy
The Lombard campaign had produced important effects throughout the rest of Italy

The Italian cause had been crushed, but revolution and war had strengthened the feeling of unity, for Neapolitans had fought for Venice, Lombards for Rome, Piedmontese for all Italy

In Piedmont itself it was at first less successful; and Cavour, although he aspired ultimately to a united Italy with Rome as the capital,1 openly professed no ambition beyond the expulsion of Austria and the formation of a North Italian kingdom

Both the king and his minister realized that Piedmont alone, even with the help of the National Society, could not expel Austria from Italy without foreign assistance


-----------------------
Cairo
In 1835 a new charter was granted to a second company, and in 1837 the Cairo City & Canal Co

I went into the streets of Cairo, and rode on the camel

In 1833 Ferdinand de Lesseps was sent as consul to Cairo, and soon afterwards given the management of the consulategeneral at Alexandria, a post that he held until 1837

When a boy he visited England, and he had an English tutor for some time in Cairo


-----------------------
Egypt
Min was especially a god of the desert routes on the east of Egypt, and the trading tribes are likely to have gathered to his festivals for business and pleasure, at Coptos (which was really near to Neapolis, Kena) even more than at Akhmim

His activity at that time was no less astounding than it was in Egypt, in Italy, in Austria, and in Prussia

On the one hand, he regards him as supreme in power, controlling the destinies of Babylonia and Egypt as well as those of Israel, and as inflexibly just in dealing with ordinary offences against morality

The people of Egypt were very proud; for they believed that they were the first and oldest of all nations


-----------------------
Oslo
The dialect spoken by everyone looked toward Oslo rather than London

In the 1200 AD Battle of Oslo, Norwegian soldiers used skis to spy on their Swedish enemies

At the age of two Frederick was proclaimed successor to the throne at the Rigsdag of Copenhagen (October 30th, 1536), and homage was done to him at Oslo for Norway in 1548

The harbours of Copenhagen, Elsinore and other towns were enlarged; many decaying towns were abolished and many new ones built under more promising conditions, including Christiania, which was founded in August 1624, on the ruins of the ancient city of Oslo


-----------------------
Norway
I shall climb very high mountains in Norway and see much ice and snow

Frank has claimed to have found oats, buckbeans, spurry, turnips, mustard, potatoes and Norway maples exercising it; Nobbe and others have imputed its possession to Elaeagnus

In the end of the 9th century Iceland was colonized from Norway; and about 985 the intrepid viking, Eric the Red, discovered Greenland, and induced some of his Icelandic countrymen to settle on its inhospitable shores

The first passes northwards, most of it between the Faeroe and Shetland Islands, to the coast of Norway, and so on to the Arctic basin, which, as Nansen has shown, it fills to a great depth


------------------------
ottawa
There is a Carnegie library, and Forest Park, within the city limits, is a popular meeting place of conventions and summer gatherings, including the annual Ottawa Chautauqua Assembly

Ottawa University (Baptist) was established here in 1865, as the outgrowth of Roger Williams University, which had been chartered in 1860 for the education of Indians on the Ottawa Reservation, and had received a grant of 20,000 acres from the Federal government in 1862

Ottawa has an important trade in grain and live-stock; soft coal and natural gas are found in the vicinity; the manufactures include flour, windmills, wire-fences, furniture, bricks, brooms and foundry products

Ottawa was settled in 1854, and was first chartered as a city in 1866

In 1837 the membership in Great Britain and Ireland was 318,716; in foreign mission stations, 66,007; in Upper Canada, 14,000; while the American Conferences had charge of 650,678 members

There are video pictures of the motor home entry from Canada back into the United States. This included Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa


-----------------------
Kabul
The north-eastern portion of this range is of great altitude, and separates the headwaters of the Oxus, which run off to the Aral Sea, from those of the Indus and its Kabul tributary, which, uniting below Peshawar, are thence discharged southward into the Arabian Sea

The kingdom of Kabul is the historic Afghanistan; the link which unites it to Kandahar, Herat and the other outlying provinces having been frequently broken and again restored by amirs of sufficient strength and capability. The geographical divisions of the country are created by the basins of its chief rivers, the Kabul, the Helmund, the Hari Rud and the Oxus

The Kabul (ancient Kophes), which is the most important (although not the largest) river in Afghanistan, rises at the foot of the Unai pass leading over the Sanglakh range, an offshoot of the Hindu Kush towards Bamian and Afghan Turkestan. Its basin forms the province of Kabul, which includes all northern Afghanistan between the Hindu Kush and the Safed Koh ranges

Below the confluence the Kabul becomes a rapid stream with a great volume of water and gradually absorbs the whole drainage of the Hindu Kush. It rises in the northern slopes of the Koh-i-Baba to the west of Kabul, and finally loses itself in the Tejend oasis north of the Trans-Caspian railway and west of Merv



-----------------------
Afghanistan
Russia, Persia, Afghanistan, Baluchistan, India and China have all revised their borders, and with the revision the political relations between these countries have acquired a new and more assured basis

The same principle of maintaining an intervening width of neutral territory between the two countries is definitely established throughout the eastern borders of Afghanistan, along the full length of which a definite boundary has been demarcated to the point where it touches the northern limits of Baluchistan on the Gomal river

From the Gomal Baluchistan itself becomes an intervening state between British India and Afghanistan, and the dividing line between Baluchistan and Afghanistan is laid down with all the precision employed on the more northerly sections of the demarcation

Seleucus entered the Punjab, but felt himself obliged in 302 to conclude a peace with Chandragupta, by which he ceded large districts of Afghanistan in return for 500 elephants

Canberra
The first Overseas player application is from Oulton Park who wish to register Australian all-rounder Jason Swift from Canberra

The 26-year-old from Canberra is on a comeback trail after a two-year layoff caused by a mystery back ailment

The increasing intensity of OSR in the rotation makes Castille and Canberra 's high level of stem canker resistance especially important

In 1909 a Board appointed to consider the several possible sites within this district reported in favour of Canberra, on the Molonglo river, near Queanbeyan, as the site for the new city, and the basins of the Molonglo, Queanbeyan and Cotter rivers were indicated as suitable to form the federal territory

Australia
You've been to Australia, haven't you?Australia is essentially the fragment of a great plateau land of Archean rocks

With the exception of Tasmania there are no important islands belonging geographically to Australia, for New Guinea, Timor and other islands of the East Indian archipelago, though not removed any great distance from the continent, do not belong to its system

Australia presents a contour wonderfully devoid of inlets from the sea except on its northern shores, where the coast-line is largely indented

The absence of active volcanoes in Australia is a state of things, in a geological sense, quite new to the continent

Doha
Cosmopolitan Doha is it's capital and here you can explore the traditional souk and the modern shopping center

The Doha Development Agenda quotes the rhetoric of sustainability; Fair Trade organizations have the experience of how to make this a reality

Doha is the capital city and main financial hub of Qatar.

It is also Qatar's fastest growing city, with over 80% of the nation's population living in Doha or its surrounding suburbs.Doha was founded in the 1820s as an offshoot of Al Bidda



-----------------------
Qatar
The Trucial chiefs of the Arabian coast hold sway between the peninsulas of Musandam and Qatar

Up to 1913 the Turks exercised the right of suzerainty over the maritime districts of El Hasa and Hofuf, and claimed it in Qatar and Kuwait

Shortly afterwards a treaty was made with the Chief of Qatar, whereby his position was assimilated to that of the Trucial chiefs

False smut disease is now affecting individual date palm trees in the north, central and south areas of Qatar

Hanoi
Hanoi is 1 For others of the name see Carthage; Hannibal; Punic Wars

Hanoi resembles a European city in the possession of wide well-paved streets and promenades, systems of electric light and drainage and a good water-supply

Hanoi is the junction of railways to Hai-Phong, its seaport, Lao-Kay, Vinh, and the Chinese frontier via Lang-Son

The Bangkok to Hanoi journey is a one-of-a-kind experience for those with a yearning for true overland adventure

Stockholm
In 1891 he was appointed lecturer in physics at Stockholm and four years later became full professor

He studied at Upsala from 1876 to 1881 and at Stockholm from 1881 to 1884, then returning to Upsala as privat-docent in physical chemistry

The Duke of Connaught's elder daughter, Princess Margaret (1882), was married in 1905 to the Crown Prince of Sweden, and died at Stockholm May 1 1920

In 1747 he was accredited to Copenhagen as Russian minister, but a few months later was transferred to Stockholm, where for the next twelve years he played a conspicuous part as the chief opponent of the French party



-----------------------
Sweden
This is the oldest industrial corporation in Sweden, and perhaps the oldest still existing in the world; it is known to have been established before 1347

He found Sweden in ruins, and devoted his whole life to laying the solid foundations of a new order of things which, in its essential features, has endured to the present day

Members of the family were also margraves of Brandenburg from 1323 to 1373, and kings of Sweden from 1654 to 1718

He had annihilated the petty kings of the South, had crushed the aristocracy, enforced the acceptance of Christianity throughout the kingdom, asserted his suzerainty in the Orkney Islands, had humbled the king of Sweden and married his daughter in his despite, and had conducted a successful raid on Denmark



-----------------------
Budapest
In 1893 the construction was completed in Budapest of an underground railway with a thin, flat roof, consisting of steel beams set close together, with small longitudinal jack arches between them

His education was completed at the Calvinist college of Sarospatak and at the university of Budapest

Supported by the influence of Louis Batthyany, after a keenly fought struggle he was elected member for Budapest in the new Diet. His complete works were published in Hungarian at Budapest in 1880-1895

Godollo is a favourite summer resort of the inhabitants of Budapest. The best life of him is that by the Bohemian historian Anton Gindely, Acta et documents historiam GabrielisBethleni illustrantia (Budapest, 1890)This work has been largely utilized by Ignae-Acsady in his excellent Gabriel Bethlen and his Court.



-----------------------
Hungary
In the 16th century, when Transylvania separated from Hungary, the town became the residence of the Transylvanian princes. Its geographical range was formerly very extensive, and included Great Britain, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, Bohemia, Hungary, Poland, Transylvania, Galicia, the Caucasus as far as the Caspian, southern Russia, Italy, Spain, Greece, Rumania, Bulgaria, Servia, and portions of central and northern Asia
. Examples may perhaps occasionally still be found in the uninhabited forests of Hungary and Transylvania, and occasionally in Spain and Greece, as well as in the Caucasus and in some of the Swiss cantons, but the original race has in most countries interbred with the domestic cat wherever the latter has penetrated

In 1246 it was the scene of a victory of the Hungarians over the Austrians; and in 1486 it was taken by Matthias Corvinus, king of Hungary, who, however, restored it to Maximilian I. In March 1473 Morton was made Master of the Rolls, and Edward found employment for his diplomatic talents; he was sent on a mission to Hungary in 1474, and was one of the negotiators of the Treaty of Pecquigny in 1475

On the restoration of peace he was appointed to high command in Hungary

He supported the claims of Bohemia to a full autonomy; he strongly attacked both the February constitution and the Ausgleich with Hungary; what he desired was a common parliament for the whole empire based on a settlement with each one of the territories

In Nepal it is said that dogs are worshipped at the festival called Khicha Puja

In Nepal, Bashahr and Rampur, and at Doda Kashtwar in the Jammu territory, opium is produced and exported to Yarkand, Khotan and Aksu

The Far West of Nepal is one of the least explored regions of the Himalayas

Lord Moira, having travelled through the northern provinces and fully studied the question, declared war against Nepal (November 1814)

-----------------------
Khartoum
I am not now dealing with General Gordon's character, which was in many respects noble, or with his military defence of Khartoum, which was heroic, but with the political conduct of his mission, and from this point of view I have no hesitation in saying that General Gordon cannot be considered to have tried to do his duty unless a very strained and mistaken view be taken of what his duty was

The dispute culminated in the assassination of General Gordon at Khartoum

In the capital, Khartoum, the Foreign Minister of Sudan's hardline Islamist government has welcomed the news

Impunity In the early days of the Darfur crisis the Khartoum government armed Arab militia to fight the rebels



-----------------------
Sudan
Since the pacification of the Sudan by the British (1886-1889) there has been some revival of trade between Gondar and the regions of the Blue Nile

Egyptian cotton was cultivated in the Sudan to the extent of 21,788 acres in 1906 chiefly on nonirrigated land

Lord Granville further inquired whether Italy would co-operate in pacifying the Sudan, and received an affirmative reply

Towards the Sudan, however, the Mahdists, who had recovered from a defeat inflicted by an Italian force at Agordat in 1890, resumed operations in December 1893



-----------------------
Kiev
In 1550 a castle was built here by the prince of Kiev, and various privileges were bestowed upon the inhabitants

In 1069 he succeeded in placing Izaslaus on the throne of Kiev, thereby confirming Poland's overlordship over Russia and enabling Boleslaus to chastise his other enemies, Bohemia among them, with the co-operation of his Russian auxiliaries

That in the Duma any Radical elements survive at all is mainly due to the peculiar franchise enjoyed by the seven largest towns - St Petersburg, Moscow, Kiev, Odessa, Riga and the Polish cities of Warsaw and Lodz

Beetroot (6-8 million tons annually) for sugar is especially cultivated in Poland, the governments of Kiev, Podolia, Volhynia, Kharkov, Bessarabia and Kherson

Ukraine
The Ukraine siphons off gas from this supply, stimulating shortages across the EU

Many westerners have used the opportunity to blockade the railroad lines linking the Ukraine to the rest of Europe

He is doing it by quadrupling the price of gas which Russia sells to the Ukraine

The Conference also heard statements by Russia on the " Five Ambassadors " proposal and Ukraine on the stalemate in the Conference




-----------------------
Lisbon
It is decidedly less at Perpignan and Lisbon than at Potsdam, Kew and Greenwich, but nowhere is the seasonal difference more conspicuous than at Tokyo, which is south of Lisbon

This three-peaked curve is not wholly pecuiiar to Paris, being seen, for instance, at Lisbon in summer

He was educated at Geneva, but, preferring an army career to a clerical one, went to Lisbon and enlisted

She left England finally with a train of one hundred persons in March 1692, travelling through France and arriving at Lisbon on the 20th of January 1693

Portugal
In 1526 he was sent out in command of an expedition fitted out for the purpose of determining by astronomical observations the exact line of demarcation, under the treaty of Tordesillas, between the colonizing spheres of Spain and Portugal, and of conveying settlers to the Moluccas

Owing to its position the city enjoys a considerable transit trade with Portugal; its other industries include the manufacture of linen, woollen and leather goods, and of pottery

Portugal, on the other hand, having abolished the Inquisition in 1821, has since 1826 allowed Jews freedom of religion, and there are synagogues in Lisbon and Faro

Portugal was first on the scene, and in the r6th century established a considerable littoral empire on the coasts of East Africa, India and China, fragments of which still remain, especially Goa, where Portuguese influence on the natives was considerable




-----------------------
Quito
A second voyage on the Amazon was made in 1561 by the mad pirate Lope de Aguirre; but it was not until 1639 that a full account was written of the great river by Father Cristoval de Acufia, who ascended it from its mouth and reached the city of Quito

The operations were carried on during eight years on a plain to the south of Quito; and, in addition to his memoir on this memorable measurement, La Condamine collected much valuable geographical information during a voyage down the Amazon

The voyage of Lord Anson to the Pacific in 1740-1744 was of a predatory character, and he lost more than half his men from scurvy; while it is not pleasant to reflect that at the very time when the French and Spaniards were measuring an arc of the meridian at Quito, the British under Anson were pillaging along the coast of the Pacific and burning the town of Payta

Godin, a member of the French commission for measuring an arc of the meridian near Quito, became professor of mathematics at San Marcos in 1750; and the botanical expeditions sent out from Spain gave further zest to scientific research

Ecuador
The Galapagos Islands are of some commercial importance to Ecuador, on account of the guano and the orchilla moss found on them and exported to Europe

The public debt of Venezuela dates back to the War of Independence, when loans were raised in Europe for account of the united colonies of Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela

An interesting link between divergent marsupial families, still living in Ecuador, the Coenolestes, is another discovery of recent years

The Spaniards, though expelled from Colombia, still held possession of the neighbouring provinces of Ecuador and Peru; and Bolivar determined to complete the liberation of the whole country

I played trumpet with big bands for many years

This could be fixed, within certain limits, at whatever pitch suited the composition; but on the horn it could be only very partially filled out by notes of a muffled quality produced by inserting the hand into the bell of the instrument, a device impossible on the trumpet

Art Farmer was blowing trumpet with the Horace Silver quintet in a piece called "Moon Rays" that Fred wouldn't have lis­tened to on his own unless someone cut off his ears

In war they trembled at the sound of a trumpet, in peace they quaked before the shouting of their own demagogues; and during the assault of Philip II


-----------------------
Algeria
Each colony and protectorate, including Algeria, has a separate budget

The value of the external trade of the French possessions, exclusive of Algeria and Tunisia, increased in the ten years 1896-1905 from 18,784,060 to 34,957,479

Youssouff acknowledged this protection given by a Frenchman by distinguishing himself in the ranks of the French army at the time of the conquest of Algeria

Ferdinand de Lesseps was also entrusted by his father with missions to Marshal Count Clausel, general-in-chief of the army of occupation in Algeria



-----------------------
Dinar
Serbia still has the dinar, but Montenegro has the euro

But the new notes will instead be a version of the Swiss dinar, which is not only economically but also politically more desirable

One month before this happened the bank had foreign exchange problems and the Jordanian dinar was devaluing every day

This was at the rate of a dinar per feddan, of which the proceeds were used in the first place for the pay of the troops and their families, with about half the amount in kind for the rations of the army

USA
It was the approach proposed by the sciences education board of the national research council in the USA

They provided expedited service similar to that offered by many states in the USA

The governments of both the USA and Canada are trying to solve the problems caused by acid rain in a number of ways

-----------------------
Dollar
It was the million dollar question

The million dollar reward, when it was available, certainly presented a temptation

He was putting up a framed twenty dollar bill on the wall next to a picture of him with the president

Before stooping to retrieve them, she handed three one hundred dollar notes to Cynthia. It was stuffed with one thousand dollar bills – fifty of them


-----------------------
Argentina
Although having a great extent of coast-line, Argentina has but few really good harbours

The lakes of Argentina are exceptionally numerous, although comparatively few are large enough to merit a name on the ordinary general map

Argentina has been a member of the Postal Union since 1878

The question of the Puna de Atacama was referred to a tribunal composed of the United States minister to Argentina and of one Argentine and one Chilean delegate; that of the southern frontier in Patagonia to the British crown



-----------------------
Peso
The peso is also the name of the Mexican dollar

A half, fifth and tenth of a peso are coined in silver, in addition to bronze coins

The Argentinian peso was pegged to the dollar and was made freely convertible

Being no longer current it has been replaced by the paper peso


-----------------------
Russia
In Russia, Joseph Stalin had thousands of writers, intellectuals, and scientists arrested and put into concentration camps

If it has come to this--we must fight as long as Russia can and as long as there are men able to stand

She published on her return an account of her experiences, under the title of Through Bolshevik Russia (1920)

In 1920 she went to Russia as a member of one of the various Labour delegations invited to inspect Soviet conditions of government



-----------------------
Ruble
He took out an assignation ruble note and gave it to Karataev

Petya shook himself, jumped up, took a ruble from his pocket and gave it to Likhachev; then he flourished the saber, tested it, and sheathed it

It was a ruble an arshin, I suppose?It is an alluvial plain for the greater part, but contains some sandy tracts, as in Ruble and Arauco; in the north very little natural forest is found except in the valleys and on the slopes of the enclosing mountain ranges, but in the south, where the rainfall is heavier, the plain is well covered with forest

Whether they were playing the ring and string game or the ruble game or talking as now, Nicholas did not leave Sonya's side, and gazed at her with quite new eyes



-----------------------
Armenia
The name Albania (in the Tosk dialect Arberia, in the Gheg Arbenia), like Albania in the Caucasus, Armenia, Albany in Britain, and Auvergne (Arvenia) in France, is probably connected with the root alb, alp, and signifies "the white or snowy uplands

At last Artabanus defeated his rival completely and occupied Ctesiphon; Vonones fled to Armenia, where he was acknowledged as king, under the protection of the Romans

The scene of the legend now shifts to Rome, where Diocletian falls in love with a lovely nun named Ripsime; she, rather than gratify his passion, flees with her abbess Gaiana and several priests to Armenia

The time had now come for Gregory, who was still a layman and father of two sons, to receive ordination; so he went to Caesarea, where Leontius ordained and consecrated him catholicos or vicar-general of Armenia

Rial
The rial or riyal is the currency of Yemen.

Generally fares vary from half a Rial to 2 Rials depending on the distance to destination.

Iranian gold coins were denominated in toman, with copper and silver coins denominated in dinar, rial or qiran.

It is the fourth-least valued currency unit in the world, after the Iranian rial, Venezuelan bolivar and Vietnamese đồng.



-----------------------
Brazil
The three great rivers that form the La Plata system - the Paraguay, Parana and Uruguay - have their sources in the highlands of Brazil and flow southward through a great continental depression, two of them forming eastern boundary lines, and one of them, the Parana, flowing across the eastern part of the republic

The northern part of Argentina, therefore, drains eastward from the mountains to these rivers, except where some great inland depression gives rise to a drainage having no outlet to the sea, and except, also, in the " mesopotamia " region, where small streams flow westward into the Parana and eastward into the Uruguay

In the same year he was nominated a Grand Cross in the Imperial Order of the Rose of Brazil; he also held the Prussian Order "Pour le Merite," and belonged to the Legion of Honour of France and to the Order of the North Star of Sweden and Norway

The only manufacturing industries of importance are cotton mills, sugar factories and distilleries, one of the largest sugar usines in Brazil being located at Riachuelo near Larangeiras

The real surprise came with his presence in the delivery room

He's not my real brother

Soon he became the real king and ruler of all Scotland,I'd be lying if I didn't admit we have expenses and we're limited in what we can do because of real life restraints, but we're not in this for a golden purse



-----------------------
Krona
The big companies spent hundreds of millions of Swedish krona on the Yes campaign

Sweden maintains its own currency, the Swedish krona (SEK), a result of the Swedes having rejected the euro in a referendum.

To see how circulation of the Swedish krona ranks compared to other currencies see Bank for International Settlements#Red Books.

He was first introduced fighting alongside Hal Jordan during the war against Krona and Nekron.


-----------------------
Euro
She joined them at the door with enough loose euro change for a couple of beers and dinner

Common options are to have a euro denominated bank account for receiving payments

Corporate bond issuance in euro this year has been spectacular

The Norwegian krone also continues to rise against the euro and dollar



-----------------------
Yen
A new law, passed by both houses and confirmed by the emperor, took from the executive all power over journals, except in cases of lse majest, and nothing now remains of the former arbitrary system except that any periodical having a political complexion is required to deposit security varying from 175 to 1000 yen

It turns out that this coin can be easily counterfeited using a 500 won (Korean currency) coin worth only 50 yen

It is based on the original manga by Ishikawa Masaru, with each of the four volumes selling for 2800 Yen apiece

Goldman sold 45 billion yen of shares in Japan's first hotel REIT in February



-----------------------
rupee
A special silver coin of rupee value has been introduced

As the Kandahari rupee is worth about 8 annas (half an English rupee) the government thus realizes a profit of 1%

Alwar was the first native state to accept a currency struck at the Calcutta mint, of the same weight and assay as the imperial rupee, with the head of the British sovereign on the obverse

In 1901 the state currency of Babashai rupees was withdrawn, and the British rupee was introduced



-----------------------
Denmark
It reverted to Hanover after the battle of Leipzig in 1813, and in 1816 was ceded to Prussia, the greater part of it being at once transferred by her to Denmark in exchange for Swedish Pomerania

The only other occasions on which he was out of the Netherlands were in 1630, when he made a flying visit to England to observe for himself some alleged magnetic phenomena, and in 16 3 4, when he took an excursion to Denmark

In 1848, when Prussia made war on Denmark, Lauenburg was occupied at her own request by some Hanoverian troops, and was then administered for three years under the authority of the German confederation, being restored to Denmark in 1851

By his beloved consort Ulrica Leonora of Denmark, from the shock of whose death in July 1693 he never recovered, he had seven children, of whom only three survived him, a son Charles, and two daughters, Hedwig Sophia, duchess of Holstein, and Ulrica Leonora, who ultimately succeeded her brother on the Swedish throne




-----------------------
krone
Then from 1st January 1900 the old reckoning by gulden was superseded, that by krone being introduced in all government accounts, the new silver being made a legal tender only for a limited amount

Since the closing years of the 19th century the Austro-Hungarian Bank had pursued a policy which had in the main the object of making the Austrian krone a gold exchange standard

The suspension of cash payment by the Austro-Hungarian Bank was continued, but the bank was bound to provide, by every means at its disposal, that the value of its notes as quoted on foreign bourses should be permanently secured in proportion to the parity of the legal mint standard of the krone currency

The Norwegian krone also continues to rise against the euro and dollar



-----------------------
dollar
It was the million dollar question

The million dollar reward, when it was available, certainly presented a temptation

He was putting up a framed twenty dollar bill on the wall next to a picture of him with the president

He removed a hundred dollar bill from his money clip and waved it in front of the shopkeeper's nose



-----------------------
naira
The Nigerian government had initially reacted to the sharp depreciation in the Nigerian naira by limiting access to foreign exchange and refusing to devalue the official exchange rate.

In 2014, the Nigerian government said Dangote had donated 150 million naira (US$750,000) to halt the spread of ebola.

He also insinuated that Eight Billion Naira was spent to corrupt legislators to support the agenda.

He said that he was alarmed that billions of naira was being lost by the nation through the subsidy regime.






-----------------------
Switzerland
Next in importance comes a mountain range, but here there is often difficulty as to the definition of the actual crest-line, and mountain ranges being broad regions, it may happen that a small independent state, like Switzerland or Andorra, occupies the mountain valleys between two or more great countries

From Switzerland he passed in six months to England, where he formed acquaintances with other French exiles and with prominent British statesmen, and imbibed a lasting admiration for the English Constitution

In 1501 Bishop Luke of Prague edited the first Protestant hymn-book; in 1502 he issued a catechism, which circulated in Switzerland and Germany and fired the catechetical zeal of Luther; in 1565 John Blahoslaw translated the New Testament into Bohemian; in1579-1593the Old Testament was added; and the whole, known as the Kralitz Bible, is used in Bohemia still

We have seen that this was the case at Athens; it was largely the case in the democratic cantons of Switzerland; indeed the nobility of Rome itself, after the privileges of the patricians were abolished, rested on no other foundation



-----------------------
Swiss
Traces of it have been found in the Swiss lake-dwellings; it is mentioned in the oldest Greek writings, and was cultivated by the Romans

To commemorate the efforts of Escher, the Swiss diet in 1823 (after his death) decided that his male descendants should bear the name of "Escher von der Linth

His proposals came to nothing, but he continued the struggle at a series of diets, and urged the Germans to emulate the courage and union of the Swiss cantons

The introduction of European immigrants dates from 1818 when a Swiss colony was located at Nova Friburgo, near Rio de Janeiro, and it was continued under the direction and with the aid of the imperial government down to the creation of the republic. Since then the state governments have assumed charge of immigration, and some of them are spending large sums in the acquisition of labourers

Thai
Lao is therefore rather a political than an ethnical title, and the people cordially dislike the name, insisting on their right to be called Thai

This Thai family includes the Shans proper, and the Siamese

Each villa captures the best of Thai design - wooden floors, Siamese furnishings and a large terrace overlooking the beach or gardens

Indian
I heard once that an Indian can smell cigarette smoke for six miles

Ethel was standing by the window, handkerchief in hand, looking like an Indian mourner at her husband's pyre

The sugar-cane flourishes, the cotton-plant ripens to perfection, date-trees are seen in the gardens, the rocks are clothed with the prickly-pear or Indian fig, the enclosures of the fields are formed by aloes and sometimes pomegranates, the liquorice-root grows wild, and the mastic, the myrtle and many varieties of oleander and cistus form the underwood of the natural forests of arbutus and evergreen oak

This was interrupted by the Indian Mutiny of 1857, but as soon as the neck of that revolt was broken, it became more urgent than ever to provide such a resource, on account of the great number of prisoners falling into British hands



-----------------------
Swedish
The Dutch trade was closed In 1814; the Swedish had been abolished in 1813

Livonia continued to be under Swedish rule, and Lithuania remained united with Poland

The Alexander legend was the theme of poetry in all European languages; six or seven German poets dealt with the subject, and it may be read in French, English, Spanish, Danish, Swedish, Icelandic, Flemish and Bohemian

This army, it is true, was so inefficient that it was completely routed by the Swedish king with a most inferior force, but it was improved gradually until it learned to conquer its Swedish opponents



-----------------------
Dutch
On the breaking out of the Dutch War in 1664 he was made treasurer of the prizes, being accountable to the king alone for all sums received or spent

It is a quiet, typically Dutch town, with its old brick houses and tree-bordered canals

Keene was once called The Elm City before Dutch elm disease destroyed the massive trees that surrounded the grassy area at the head of the square

In 1815 he commanded the Dutch and Belgian contingents, and won high commendations for his courage and conduct at the battles of Quatre Bras and Waterloo, at the latter of which he was wounded





-----------------------
Korea
From Manchuria, it was assumed, the political influence and spontaneous infiltration would naturally spread to Korea, and on the deeply indented coast of the Hermit Kingdom might be constructed new ports and arsenals more spacious and strategically more important than Port Arthur

From the Khingan ranges to the Pacific, south of the Amur, stretch the rich districts of Manchuria, a province which connects Russia with the Korea by a series of valleys formed by the Sungari and its affluents - a land of hill and plain, forest and swamp, possessing a delightful climate, and vast undeveloped agricultural resources

In the sphere of direct influence fall Korea, Japan and Annam; in the outer sphere are Mongolia, Tibet, Siam, Cambodia and Burma, where Indian and Chinese influence are combined, the

The second half of the 16th century was a period of ferment and anarchy, marked by the arrival of the Portuguese and the rise of some remarkable adventurers, one of whom, Hideyoshi, conquered Korea and apparently meditated the invasion of China



-----------------------
Korean
By both learned and popular belief in Korea Ki-tze is recognized as the founder of Korean social order, and is greatly reverenced

Small in stature, with a well-knit frame, the cheekbones prominent, the face generally round, the nose and neck short, a marked tendency to prognathism, the chest broad and well developed, the trunk long, the hands small and delicate this Malay type is found in nearly all the islands along the east coast of the Asiatic continent as well as in southern China and in the extreme south-west of Korean peninsula

The real beginnings of the study of painting and sculpture in their higher branches must be dated from the introduction of Buddhism from China in the middle of the 6th century, and for three centuries after this event there is evidence that the practice of the arts was carried on mainly by or under the instruction of Korean and Chinese immigrants

The ceramic art in Satsuma owed much to the aid of a number of Korean experts who settled there after the return of the Japanese forces from Korea



-----------------------
Russian
There were two Germans and a Russian officer in the room

For the first time, after a fortnight's retreat, the Russian troops had halted and after a fight had not only held the field but had repulsed the French

Germany viewed the Russian mobilization as an act of war and therefore declared war on Russia

She sometimes thought his accent sounded Russian, sometimes Irish

German
The German doctor went up to Lorrain

-----------------------
Portuguese
It was not until 1526 that the embassy was dismissed; and not many years afterwards the negus entreated the help of the Portuguese against Mahommedan invaders, and the viceroy sent an expeditionary force, commanded by his brother Cristoforo da Gama, with 450 musketeers

On this occasion the palace was plundered and the town burnt; but the Portuguese were finally repulsed, and fled to their ships after heavy loss

The first Portuguese expedition sent out to capture Malacca was under the command of Diogo Lopez de Siqueira and sailed from Portugal in 1508

The Portuguese were satisfied with the possession of Malacca itself and did not seek further to extend their empire in Malaya

Slovakia
The Protestants number about one million, the largest body being the Evangelical Church in Slovakia with a membership of over 400,000

The Greek Church in Slovakia and SubCarpathian Russia has a membership of over 500,000, while the Jews number about 350,000

Slovakian
They were accompanied by ten Romanian divisions, three Italian divisions, two Slovakian divisions and nine Romanian and four Hungarian brigades.

The Romanian, Hungarian, Italian and Slovakian air units were involved in the combats.

The viola is also an important accompaniment instrument in Slovakian, Hungarian and Romanian folk string band music, especially in Transylvania.

They cluster closest to the Ukrainian and Slovakian population, "providing evidence for their genetic isolation from the Serbian majority population".





-----------------------
Poland
The wedding was celebrated at Torgau on the 14th of October 1711, in the house of the queen of Poland, and three weeks later the bridegroom was hurried away by his father to Thorn to superintend the provisioning of the Russian troops in Poland

After being educated at Cracow, he made the grand tour with his brother Mark and returned to Poland in 1648

Beer is chiefly brewed in Poland and the Baltic provinces

On returning to Poland he was for a time in the Russian service, but lost his post, and his liberty as well for some time, for his outspokenness





-----------------------
Polish
This ill-timed parsimony reacted injuriously upon Polish politics

What sort of Polish mazuwka is this?As the garage door lifted, sunlight reflected off the polish she and her siblings had applied that last day of their lives

The epoch-making victory of the 12th of September 1683 was ultimately decided by the charge of the Polish cavalry led by Sobieski in person

He was in fact a typical representative of the unscrupulous selfseeking Polish magnates of the 17th century who were always ready to sacrifice everything, their country included, to their own private ambition

Italian
They silently spooned up Italian ice cream, content in this measure of understanding that was growing between them

Where do they go for Italian food?Gathering volunteers in the autumn of 1867, he prepared to enter papal territory, but was arrested at Sinalunga by the Italian government and conducted to Caprera

Their presence put an end to the plan for the invasion of the papal states, and Garibaldi unwillingly issued a decree for the plebiscite which was to sanction the incorporation of the Two Sicilies in the Italian realm

On the outbreak of war in 1866 he assumed command of a volunteer army and, after the defeat of the Italian troops at Custozza, took the offensive in order to cover Brescia

On the Norwegian coast mackerel fishing does not begin before May, whilst on the English coasts large catches are frequently made in March

The other day, I met a deaf Norwegian gentleman, who knows Ragnhild Kaata and her teacher very well, and we had a very interesting conversation about her

It had long the reputation of being almost constantly ice-bound, but after the Norwegian captain Johannesen had demonstrated its accessibility in 1869, and Nordenskield had crossed it to the mouth of the Yenisei in 1875, it was considered by many to offer a possible trade route between European Russia and the north of Siberia

Mexico
In Mexico the national government is carrying out a consistent policy of developing its railway lines

She was an author, she explained with a puff of her ample bosom, and had just returned from Roswell, New Mexico, Mecca of the strange and alien

In old days New Mexico was the home of a breed of hairless cats, said to have been kept by the ancient Aztecs, but now well-nigh if not completely extinct

Although during the composition of the Ferdinand and Isabella it had been of very intermittent service to him, it had so far improved that he could read with a certain amount of regularity during the writing of the Conquest of Mexico, and also, though in a less degree, during the years devoted to the Conquest of Peru

Thomas, and a monolithic shaft to the memory of General John Ellis Wool (1784-1869), who served with distinction in the War of 1812 and in the Mexican War, and in the Civil War commanded for a time the Department of Virginia

But his attire was forgotten as soon as the quartet entered the Buen Tiempo, Ouray's popular Mexican restaurant

At the least there should be some consideration of four separate systems of discovery - the Eastern, in which Chinese and Japanese explorers acquired knowledge of the geography of Asia, and felt their way towards Europe and America; the Western, in which the dominant races of the Mexican and South American plateaus extended their knowledge of the American continent before Columbus; the Polynesian, in which the conquering races of the Pacific Islands found their way from group to group; and the Mediterranean

Benzoni, on the other hand, whose Travels in America (1542-1556) were published in 1565, says that the Mexican name of the herb was "tabacco". Mexico is an important tobacco-producing country, and Mexican leaf is largely used in Europe for cigar wrappers and other purposes




-----------------------
Japanese
The Japanese have produced few books of importance, and their compositions are chiefly remarkable as being lighter and more secular than is usual in Asia, but the older Chinese works take high rank both for their merits and the effect they have had

I never realized what a wonderful people the Japanese are until I saw their most interesting exhibit

The eighth voyage, led by Captain Saris, extended the operations of the company to Japan; and in 1613 the Japanese government granted privileges to the company; but the British retired in 1623, giving up their factory

The contrast between the yellow and white types has been softened by the remarkable development of the Japanese following the assimilation of western methods

Australian
There are no mountains behind the Great Australian Bight

A narrow Cambrian sea must have extended across central Australia from the Kimberley Goldfield in the north-west, through Tempe Downs and the Macdonnell chain in central Australia, to the South Australian highlands, central Victoria at Mansfield, and northern Tasmania

Of those peculiar to Australian waters may be mentioned the arripis, represented by what is called among the colonists a salmon trout

The Australian eucalyptus is now grown in many places, and there are groves of the paradise or paraiso tree (Melia azedarach) on the formerly treeless pampa

Ireland
In Ireland In Ormonde had succeeded in uniting the English and the Ireland

When Henry Smith was just two years old his father died, whereupon his mother left Ireland for England

The Roman Catholic landowners lost their estates, all or part according to their degree of guilt, and these were distributed among Cromwell's soldiers and the creditors of the government; Cromwell also invited new settlers from home and from New England, two-thirds of the whole land of Ireland being thus transferred to new proprietors

By March 1652 the whole of the territory governed by the Stuarts had submitted representatives from Scotland and from Ireland

He hadn't visited the Guardians' Irish station in years, mainly because Ireland had no regular vamp population

Irish in a league against the supporters of the parliament, and only a few scattered forts held out for the Commonwealth, while the young king was every day expected to land and complete the conquest of the island

The English and Irish provinces are treated as self-contained




-----------------------
Croatia
Anti-Italian demonstrations occurred periodically also at Vienna, while in Dalmatia and Croatia Italian fishermen and workmen (Italian citizens, not natives) were subject to attacks by gangs of half-savage Croats, which led to frequent diplomatic incidents

Hungary afforded him a brief respite; and in 1244 peace was concluded after a Bosnian campaign against Croatia

At this period the Servian empire had reached its zenith; Hungary, governed by the feeble monarch, Charles Robert of Anjou, was striving to crush the insurgent magnates of Croatia; Venice, whose commercial interests were imperilled, desired to restore peace and maintain the balance of power

The death of Louis in 1392, the regency of his widow Elizabeth, and a fresh outbreak in Croatia, enabled Tvrtko to fulfil his predecessor's designs by establishing a maritime state




-----------------------
Croatian
The Croatian dialects, like the Servian, have gradually developed from the Old Slavonic, which survives in medieval liturgies and biblical or apocryphal writings

From 1299 to 1322 the country was ruled by the Croatian princes, Paul and Mladen Subic, who, though vassals of Hungary, reunited the provinces of Upper and Lower Bosnia, created by the Hungarians in order to prevent the growth of a dangerous national unity

The border counties, now formed into a military zone, were planted exclusively with Croatian colonists as being more trustworthy defenders of the Hungarian frontier than the Hungarians themselves

Within certain limits Croatia's autonomy was respected, but so far from Zagreb being consulted, the terms of the new settlement were in effect dictated from Budapest and only submitted pro forma to a carefully " packed " Croatian Diet, after the bargain between Budapest and Vienna had already made of them an accomplished fact

French
His French accent rolled off his deep voice in a way that made her smile

The impossibility of reconciling the financial requirements of the national party with the demands of the British and French controllers of the public debt, compelled him to resign in the following February

I had had, moreover, a good start in French, and received six months' instruction in Latin; but German was the subject with which I was most familiar

I know a woodchopper, of middle age, who takes a French paper, not for news as he says, for he is above that, but to "keep himself in practice," he being a Canadian by birth; and when I ask him what he considers the best thing he can do in this world, he says, beside this, to keep up and add to his English




-----------------------
Danish
There are generally in a coloni three or four Danish houses, built of wood and pitched over, in addition to storehouses and a blubber-boiling establishment

The traditional loyalty of the Danish middle classes was transformed into a boundless enthusiasm for the king personally, and for a brief period Frederick found himself the most popular man in his kingdom

The Alexander legend was the theme of poetry in all European languages; six or seven German poets dealt with the subject, and it may be read in French, English, Spanish, Danish, Swedish, Icelandic, Flemish and Bohemian

He also negotiated treaties for the purchase of the Danish West Indies, the Bay of Samana, and for American control of the isthmus of Panama; but these were not ratified by the Senate
